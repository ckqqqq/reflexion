# Reflexion Implementation

Code for the approach proposed in [Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)

### Note
Reflexion is not a replacement for [ReAct](https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct) or any other decision-guiding approach! It is a simple retry technique that can be used enhance other approaches.

Check out a [implementation](https://github.com/noahshinn024/reflexion-human-eval) using Reflexion to master HumanEval (88% pass@1 accuracy)
